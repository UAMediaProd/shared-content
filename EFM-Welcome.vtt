MERCY ATIENO OLOO:
Welcome and thank you

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.860 align:middle line:84%
for enrolling in the
Entrepreneurship Foundations

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.300 align:middle line:90%
and Mindset subject.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.200 align:middle line:84%
My name is Mercy and I'm your
course coordinator and tutor.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I run my own startup and I
also work as a program manager

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:90%
for a charity.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm passionate about
entrepreneurship

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and innovation, and
my passion stems

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:84%
from wanting to empower women
and create lasting impacts

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:90%
for their future.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I was born in Kenya
and grew up in Canada.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:84%
After graduating from my
first degree up until 2016,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:90%
I worked as a tax accountant.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Within this field I
had the opportunity

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
of working with individuals
across the globe

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and gained experience
with tax compliance

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:90%
from various countries.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:84%
However, at the
time, I didn't really

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
understand how to
bring my creativity

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and ideas into my work.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I've always been a risk
taker and adventurous.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:84%
In my move to sharpen my
entrepreneurial mindset,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:84%
I moved from Canada to
Australia to pursue an MBA

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Adelaide.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:84%
The exposure and connections
I made in my studies

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and within the
entrepreneurial ecosystem

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to start
my own business.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm the co-founder of
HRU Global, an online platform

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:84%
connecting and championing
fellow female entrepreneurs

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:90%
in the digital marketplace.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I have learned
that entrepreneurs

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.440 align:middle line:84%
go through a lot of trials,
experiments, failure, learning

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and iteration, and
these processes

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:84%
can be quite
difficult to navigate.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Being creative, flexible
and open to new ideas

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:90%
has allowed me to be successful.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:84%
In reflecting upon my
journey in entrepreneurship,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I would encourage anyone
looking to set up a business

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
or develop an
entrepreneurial mindset to be

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:90%
ready for an exciting journey.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:84%
The Entrepreneurship
Foundations and Mindset subject

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
gives a general overview
of entrepreneurship

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and focuses on the
entrepreneurial mindset.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.670 align:middle line:84%
The skills you acquire
in this subject

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
will prepare you for creating
your own entrepreneurial career

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:84%
path, being a valued corporate
team member - intrepreneur -

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and using your
enterprising skills

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:84%
for working within government
or the non for profit sector.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.120 align:middle line:84%
An entrepreneurial mindset is a
way of thinking that allows you

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
to achieve goals as you develop
your own business or work

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:90%
within an organisation.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I hope that your ability to
identify opportunities, think

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and behave in a more
entrepreneurial way

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:84%
will improve over the
duration of the subject.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:84%
This subject will equip you
with the right theoretical and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
practical tools to
help you navigate

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:90%
the world of entrepreneurship.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
This subject has been designed
so that your time on each task

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
is evenly distributed throughout
the 12 modules of learning.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
You will notice that as you
progress through the subject,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:84%
the focus of how you're
studying slowly shifts.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
The early modules address
learning primarily

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:84%
through reading content,
watching and listening

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
to videos, and listening
to audio presentations.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
The middle part
of the subject is

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
reflective of the
time you'll spend

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:84%
on the more practical elements
that you're learning about,

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
while the time you spend
learning through reading,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.830 align:middle line:84%
watching and listening
reduces slightly.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And the latter
modules enable you

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:84%
to devote more time practicing
and refining two out

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:84%
of the four formal
submissions of this subject,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.740 align:middle line:84%
which represent 65 per
cent of your overall grade,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
while the amount of time
you spend reading, watching

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and listening is
reduced even further.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:84%
The subject has been designed
in such a way that you will

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:84%
immediately recognise the core
concepts of learning on each

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
page, no matter how
you choose to study.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
While it's strongly
advised that you

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:84%
plan to study
chronologically, that

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:84%
is beginning at the
Orientation section

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and progressing to Module
1, Module 2 and so on,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:84%
you're welcome to
explore, especially

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
if you see a topic that you're
keen to learn more about.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Upon completion of
this subject, you'll

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:84%
be able to identify the
differences between an idea

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and an opportunity and examine
entrepreneurial behavior

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:90%
and characteristics.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Whether you go into developing
your own business or work

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:84%
within your organisation,
you'll be able to: assess

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:84%
the potential of an opportunity
and determine its viability;

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
identify how to
attract resources,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:84%
manage intellectual
property, legal structures,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
ethical issues and risks; and
prepare a feasibility report.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:84%
You will have contact with me
during the weekly tutorials

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
where you'll be encouraged
to engage and ask questions.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:84%
You'll also be able to
generate conversations

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.760 align:middle line:84%
via the discussion board by
initiating conversations,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
responding to discussion
questions that I have prepared,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and asking questions about the
concepts and theories covered

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:90%
in the subject.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:90%
