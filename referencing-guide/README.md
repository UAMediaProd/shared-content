## Project setup

Install any dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Start local development server to build.

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

When the changes are good, run build to create the `dist` folder and then push to Github. Auto Page Builds are not available for this specific folder in this repo like the original and must be manually built-then-pushed.

```bash
npm run build
```
